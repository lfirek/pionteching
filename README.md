### Why this code is green?

Each line of code has the potential to reduce your carbon footprint. All three tasks were accomplished with less than 140 lines of code!

### Basic objectives

Each task is described with examples and openapi specifications provided. The main objective of the task is to execute the most efficient code possible to reduce the carbon footprint. The specification indicates that only valid requests should be sent, which should return an http 200 code.

### Why was it done this way?

Quarkus is framework that offers unequaled performance with great resources management.

> **_NOTE:_** This application has great ability to improve performance by using native executable via GraalVM, but the task limits the available software to use.

### How to run?

```bash
./build.sh

./run.sh
```
